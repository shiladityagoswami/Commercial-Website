# Commercial-Website
Commercial website for Online Electronic gadgets

The purpose of this project is to create a responsive commercial website (e-store).
With the help of HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT we have created the front end of the website and connected it with MySQL database using JSP.
The end result is a website having different choices for the user to place an order.
The user can do one time Sign Up and after that he or she can access the website by logging in.
Whenever the user buys places an order the product details along with the buyer details are stored inside the MySQL database which the admin has access to update the Data.

Note : No payment method/interface is implemented as this is for learning & educational purpose only.

Thank You.
